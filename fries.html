        <p>
            Fries are one of my favorite things to eat, but they aren't the healthiest. They are deep-fried in oil 
            making them high in calories and trans/saturated fat. There is also a lot of salt in most fries
            you buy from fast food restaurants. In this recipe, an air-fryer is used which significantly 
            reduces the calories and the amount of oil needed to make them. Olive oil is a great alternative
            to other commonly used seed oils, as it can reduce inflammation in the body and contains 
            antioxidants. They still come out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside from the convection 
            heating in the air fryer. I also like to add toppings on the fries like chicken, for protein 
            and guacamole for healthy fats. Cheese also adds some protein, healthy fat and nutrients like calcium, B12, zinc, etc.

        <h3 class="r_headers">Steps</h3>

        <ul id="rec_list">  
            <li>Step 1: Take a medium sized bowl and fill it with cold water and ice; you will use this for the potatos.
                Take your potatoes and use a knife or peeler to take the skin off. Then cut them into strips any size you 
                would prefer. Place them in the ice water.
            </li>
            <li>Step 2: When you are ready to use the potatos, put them into another bowl, and add a tablespoon 
                of olive oil, and all of your spices (salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder). Mix thoroughly with your hands
                to coat all of the fries.
            </li>
            <li>Step 3: Take a metal sheet or basket (that the air-fryer comes with) and dump your fries into it. Now add your 
                shredded chicken on top of the fries making it distributed evenly. After the chicken is placed do the same with
                the shredded cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Step 4: Get your air-fryer ready and set it to 370&deg;F; it should only take a few minutes to heat up so turn it
                on when you are ready to cook. Put your fries into the oven and leave them in for about 15 minutes. Take them out 
                when they are crispy to your liking.
            </li>
            <li>Step 5: Now that they are cooked put them into a separate plate and top with a couple tablespoons of guacamole. You 
                can also add any other toppings that you prefer to add, this is just what I did. Enjoy!
