        <p>
            I like to make this recipe a lot during the fall, as I personally love pumpkin-flavored foods.
             I always look for a dessert that is not super unhealthy but tastes sweet and has health benefits.
              These muffins are packed with high fiber, protein, antioxidants, and vitamins from the pumpkin purée.
               Some beneficial vitamins include: vitamin A, C, and E. Pumpkin spice also has healthy spices such
               as cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and allspice in it. These spices have health benefits, including
               anti-inflammatory properties, blood sugar regulation, and aided digestion, especially from the 
               cinnamon and ginger.

        <h3 class="r_headers">Steps</h3>

        <ul id="rec_list">  
            <li>Step 1: Pre-heat your oven to 350&deg;F.
            </li>
            <li>Step 2: Blend all the dry ingredients in a medium sized bowl, until there is a fine flour-like texture, this
                includes the oat flour, protein powder, baking soda/powder, salt, and pumpkin spice.
            </li>
            <li>Step 3: In another medium sized bowl, mix together all of the wet ingredients, like the milk, purée,
                maple syrup, eggs, vanilla extract.
            </li>
            <li>Step 4: Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients bowl in intervals, and fold it in. Don't do
                it all at once as it will be harder to blend. Add Majority of the chocolate/white chips into the final mixture.
                Remember to leave some to top the muffins.
            </li>
            <li>Step 5: Take a greased muffin pan and pour in the mixture. Top the muffins with the extra chips you previously
                saved. Place the pan in the oven and leave in for 35-40 minutes. Stick a knife into the muffins to see if they
                are cooked. If they come out without any batter than they are finished. Enjoy!
            </li>
            <li>Step 5: Add all the ingredients together. Take the cooked bulgur which should be cooled 
                now and add it to the bowl, along with the parsley, mint, and onions. Finally, add your dressing mixture 
                into the bowl and mix it around until it is evenly coated. It is best to wait about 10 minutes before 
                serving this dish as it lets the flavors settle. You can eat it immediately, and store it in the fridge when done.</li>
