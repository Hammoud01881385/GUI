        <p>
            This is an easy recipe that does not require that much cooking and tastes great. I love
            to order nachos at Mexican restaurants, which aren't super unhealthy, but they are easy
            and cheaper to make at home. It simply consists of tortilla chips, shredded chicken, cheese,
            and your desired toppings. I like to put things like sour cream, salsa, and jalape&ntilde;os,
            because these are things I usually have in my fridge. However, you can add any toppings you 
            like.
        </p>

        <h3 class="r_headers">Steps</h3>

        <ul id="rec_list">  
            <li>Step 1: Take a metal sheet or basket (that the air-fryer comes with) and dump your chips into it.
            </li>
            <li>Step 2: Now add your shredded chicken on top of the chips making it distributed evenly. After 
                the chicken is placed do the same with the shredded cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Step 3: Get your air-fryer ready and set it to 400&deg;F; it should only take a few minutes to heat up so turn it
                on when you are ready to cook. Put your sheet into the oven and leave them in for about 5 minutes. You just want
                the cheese to melt and the chicken to be warm, nothing really needs to cook.
            </li>
            <li>Step 4: Now that they are cooked put them into a separate plate and drizzle 2 tablespoons of sour cream on top. Do
                the same with the salsa and/or any other toppings you want to put.
            </li>
            <li>Step 5: Take your alape&ntilde;os and dice them into quarter pieces with a knife. Sprinkle them on top of the 
                nachos and enjoy!
            </li>
