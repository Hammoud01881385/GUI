            Tabbouleh is a traditional Middle Eastern dish that originated in Lebanon. 
            It is a salad mainly consisting of chopped parsley, tomatoes, and bulgur wheat. 
            As a Lebanese American this dish is made a lot in my family. 
            My mom made Tabbouleh a lot throughout my childhood, it was always one of my favorite foods. 
            Tabbouleh is a refreshing, colorful and filling salad packed with a lot of healthy ingredients and nutrients. 
            One of the core ingredients, bulgur wheat, is a whole grain that is made from cracked wheat kernels 
            that have been partially boiled and dried. It is what gives the salad high fiber, protein, iron and magnesium. 
            The variety of ingredients give Tabbouleh rich nutrients, such as vitamin A, C, K, folate, and potassium which 
            can help things like blood clotting and bone health. Another health benefit of tabbouleh is that it has 
            anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation in the body and reduce your risk of 
            chronic diseases. Overall, a very healthy and delicious food to make.

        <h3 class="r_headers">Steps</h3>

        <ul id="rec_list">  

            <li>Step 1: Rinse the bulgur wheat with a mesh strainer under cold water. Take a pot and bring a cup of 
                water to a boil. You want the ratio of water to bulgur to be 2:1. Once boiling, add the rinsed bulgur 
                and cover the pot. Reduce the heat to low for about 10-15 minutes or when the bulgur absorbs the water. 
                Once cooked, remove it from the heat and let it cool for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 2:  Dice your cucumber and tomato into very small pieces with a sharp knife. Toss them into a medium 
                sized bowl and add ½ a teaspoon of salt. Stir it around and let the mixture rest for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Rinse your parsley, mint and onion under cold water. Pat these ingredients down with a paper towel 
                to dry them. Cut the parsley, mint, and onion into fine pieces. Now add them to the same medium sized bowl 
                with the tomatoes and cucumbers and stir.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Take the flat side of a chef knife to smash the garlic. Now take away the skin of the clove. 
                Finely mince the garlic as small as you can. In a small cup add ⅓ cup of olive oil and 3 tablespoons of 
                lemon juice, the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt, and your minced garlic. Whisk this all together until it is evenly mixed.</li>
            <li>Step 5: Add all the ingredients together. Take the cooked bulgur which should be cooled 
                now and add it to the bowl, along with the parsley, mint, and onions. Finally, add your dressing mixture 
                into the bowl and mix it around until it is evenly coated. It is best to wait about 10 minutes before 
                serving this dish as it lets the flavors settle. You can eat it immediately, and store it in the fridge when done. Enjoy!</li>
